    <h2>Accepting these Terms</h2>

    <p>
      If you access or use the Service, it means you agree to be bound by all of
      the terms below. So, before you use the Service, please read all of the
      terms. If you don't agree to all of the terms below, please do not use the
      Service. Also, if a term does not make sense to you, please let us know by

    </p>

    <h2>Changes to these Terms</h2>

    <p>
      We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For instance, we

      some other reason.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever we make changes to these Terms, the changes are effective 2 days
      after we post such revised Terms (indicated by revising the date at the

      your immediate acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through
      confirmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check
      Spectrum for changes to these Terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into effect,
      then you have accepted the changes to these Terms.
