        # the new thread to handle a few downstream operations:
        #
        # First, when a thread is published, we notify the dashboard 'everything'
        # query and insert the new thread into the threads list. That way if a
        # user publishes a thread and navigates to the homepage, their thread will
        # appear without needing to refetch
        #
        # Additionally, we want to get back the channelId and communityId
        # so that the community and channel the thread is posted under can
        # trigger their reducers and automatically add the new thread to the
        # store. See 'views/community/queries.js' for an example of this
        # reducer operation in use.
        #
        # The underlying goal here is to ensure that when a thread is published,
        # it will appear in all the feeds a user would expect it to appear
        # and play nicely with Apollo in th event that a feed was previously
        # fetched and cached
