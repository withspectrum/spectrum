	2. For users who are already on Specrum and are not in the community, generate a new
			notification with the invitation. We don't worry at all about bundling for this
			type of notification since they will rarely overlap, and are high enough signal
			that showing multiple community invitation notifications is fine.
			For each of these users, proceed to 3
	3. For users who are both on Spectrum but not a member of the community, and users who
			are not on Spectrum, send an email invitation
			3a. generate a communityInvitation record in the db
			3b. send an email
