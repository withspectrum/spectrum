/**
 * We do some crazy timeout stuff here to avoid sending too many emails. The flow goes like this:
 *
 * - A message notification comes in, this function is called and sets a timeout for one minute to send the email
 * - No further message notification for the same recipient comes in so we send the email after one minute
 * - If another message notification comes in before one minute has passed we reset the timer to one minute and add the new notification to the list of threads to be batched into one email
 * - We repeat this process for each further message notification until we have a one minute break
 * - Because we do want people to get emails in a timely manner we force push them out after 10 minutes. Basically, if we get a message notification and no email has been sent but it's been more than 10 minutes since the very first notification we send the email with all current notifications batched into one email.
