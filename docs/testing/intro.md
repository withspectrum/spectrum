# Testing

We have a test suite consisting of a bunch of unit tests (mostly for the API) and integration tests to verify Spectrum keeps working as expected. The entire test suite is run in CI for every commit and PR, so if you introduce a breaking change the CI will fail and the PR will not be merge-able.
