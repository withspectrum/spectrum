# Hyperion

*Hyperion: (/haɪˈpɪəriən/) is one of the twelve Titan children of Gaia and Uranus.*

Hyperion is the server responsible for server-side rendering the front end. In production, Hyperion does an initial render of a requested view on the server and responds with static HTML. The static HTML is then rehydrated with our JS bundle.
